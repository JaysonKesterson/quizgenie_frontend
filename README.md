Getting Started

To get started you will need to clone the backend API which is coded in Ruby on Rails and start a rails server using the rails s command in the terminal. The link to the backend is "https://github.com/JaysonKesterson/quizgenie_backend"

From the front end you will need to open the index.html file in your browser with the rails server running so that the frontend can pull from the api, from here you can create and play quizzes!
